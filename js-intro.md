# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function takes an argument and produces an outcome by manipulating the arguments. You'd use a function to return new values from an input.
#### 2. What is a method?
A method is a modifier. We can use methods on variables or products of another function to further manipulate the inputs/outputs
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
.sort() .concat() .join() .shift() .split()
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessors use information from an array and return a new array without changing the original. Mutators return a new array but also permanently alter the original. You'd use an accessor to return a result from data that you don't want to change. You'd mutate an array if you want the original to be altered by the function you are implementing on it.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
When returning, you are asking the function to record the result of that section of a function to be hoisted out to the outer shell to be considered by the part of the function above it. This will not show up in the log, but the computer will still run the function and save the result. A console log is a return value that is local. It does not return a result to be considered by the outer shell of the function, but is a visible feedback tool for a developer to make sure each section of their code is performing how it is supposed to.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
Looping the arrays in week one definitely helped me the most. I was able to understand the logic of Javascript much better by manipulating arrays in lots of different ways.
